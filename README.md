This repository is a homework assignment from au10tix made by me Mikael Epelbaum.

To run the code you can install the requirements

run the following command in the directory.
pip install -r requirements.txt 

now you can run the code from the main.py

it will print two rows.
the first is the number of open issues in the given directory
the second is the number of open issues with the label "practice1"


I have used the requests and the json libraries in this repo.
I have created a configuration file where you can find the parameters for the given repository
you can change it to a new repository if desired.

the methods and their call are ordered in the same way according to the scenarios in the word file.
